Swarm robotics:  Current research directions at IRIDIA
</b>
<br />
Swarm robotics studies how to design and implement groups of robots that operate without relying on any external infrastructure or on any form of centralized control. Such robot swarms exploit self-organization to perform tasks that require cooperation between the robots. In the last ten years there has been a lot of progress in swarm robotics research. Quite complex robot swarms have been demonstrated in a number of different case studies. However, this progress has also led to the identification of some problems that might hinder further development. In the talk, I will discuss what I consider to be the main current issues in swarm robotics research. I will then propose a few novel research directions that could allow us to successfully address these issues and therefore take robot swarms one step closer to real world deployment.

From Visual Recognition to Visual Understanding
</b>
<br />

This talk gives an overview of some of our recent work on models for visual recognition and visual understanding. 
<br />

The first part of the talk presents a new visual recognition model, called DenseNet. DenseNets change the common connectivity pattern of convolutional networks by using the activations from all prior layers as input into a layer. It also presents an extension, called multi-scale DenseNet, that has the ability to adapt dynamically to computational resource limits at inference time. Specifically, our architecture spends less computation on “easy” images, and uses the surplus computation to obtain higher accuracy on “hard” images.
<br />

The second half of the talk presents our work on moving from visual recognition to visual understanding, focusing on a problem setting known as visual question answering. It discusses the problems of biases in current visual question answering benchmarks and presents a new benchmark, called CLEVR, that aims to overcome these problems. We use CLEVR to study a new type of deep models that aims to model the reasoning processes required to answer questions more explicitly than standard models.

Digital Replicants and Mind-Uploading 
</b>
<br />

Strange things are beginning to happen with AI. One of them is the creation of virtual agents that mimick real people. Replika (https://replika.ai/) is a good example. It is a company that creates AI chatbots based on the digital traces of a person (email, twitter, facebook, etc.) and was originally set up to preserve the memory of deceased relatives. More recently it launched an app so that a living person can make a digital copy of him or herself, which can then autonomously send messages or perform actions in lieu of the person, and would ultimately survive its owner in cyberspace. These developments, and there are several more intriguing things happening, such as brain-computer interfaces, neural implants, mind uploading, and augmented reality, are beginning to have a remarkable impact on how people start thinking about age-old questions that used to be the domain of religion: Do we have a soul that can survive our body? Is (digital) immortality possible? What if we begin to have artificial agents that mingle with our own digital replicants? And what if these agents have bad intentions? Can a cyborg emerge which is based on a human body augmented with a broad range of digital devices and artificial intelligence? 
<br />

Together with neuroscientist Oscar Vilarroya, I have been exploring this future impact of AI on our society and on the image that humanity has of itself. Rather than writing scientific papers, we decided to write an opera, Fausto, that imagines a future where digital replicants and mind uploading are common. Vilarroya in the role of libretist used the age-old saga of Faust as the narrative backbone and myself, being the composer, used the language of the Western musical tradition exploring melody, harmony and rhythm to express the emotional turbulences of the main characters. My talk will present both the philosophical ideas behind this opera and show some clips of a recent performance.

Recursive theory of mind: between logic and cognition
</b>
<br />

Computational agents often reason about other agents' beliefs, knowledge, goals and plans, based on extensions of modal logics of knowledge and belief. Usually, such agents are capable of an arbitrary amount of recursion when reasoning about the mental states of other computational agents. However, people lose track of such `recursive theory of mind' reasoning after a few levels.
<br />

This lecture is about several strands of research related to recursive theory of mind, starting with the question how children develop from first-order theory of mind ('Dad doesn't know that I took the chocolate") to second-order theory of mind ("Alice believes that I believe that she wrote a novel under pseudonym"). Another question is why adults are not very good at higher-order strategic reasoning in games and how software agents can support them to improve their social sophistication. Finally, there is the question why higher-order theory of mind has evolved in the first place, if it’s so difficult. To investigate these questions, we take logic into the lab and combine epistemic logic, computational cognitive models, agent-based models, and empirical research.
